Master Thesis - Battery Uncertainty Modelling

### Demo
1. Select thesis_demo.ipynb
2. Click "Open in Colab"

If you don't like Google Colab, I have also uploaded my environment .yml file.
You can use it to create your local environment and run it locally.

NOTE: If you do this, make sure that "uncertainty_modelling_core.py" and the csv file are in your PATH.
